        <p class="comment">There is sort of conspiracy going on is that some old man that had so much stuff in his life is going to the beaches of Miami and place down banana on the wall, duct taping it and walking away. Everybody were too amused about the banana itself and trying to think what it should be called. I think it will be called "Comedian", or some shit.</p>
