                <h2 class="glow">How to code in HTML 101 [Cheatsheet]</h2>

                <p>
                    This is where I would put stuff about HTML and CSS over here, but hold on, am I that competent to do it? Possibly, I am too drunk.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I was starting HTML & CSS, I had no idea what I was doing other than propping in templates 
                    that I found on forums and such, till I realized there are content creators 
                    that make videos about HTML. I would be learning from them as I be coding my websites, each day I grew more comfortable on what to do.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    
                </p>

                <p>There are also some things that you need to learn are flexboxes, they're sort of bane to any web developer's existance, but if you take your time looking at this image, you start to understand how you would be using them correctly when you need to hop on CSS.</p>

                <p>
                    I will suggest for you to watch this video to learn everything about HTML & CSS. You gotta get started with setting up your github account, the repository and some drinks with you.

                    I recommend checking out those links as well.
                     They provide a lot of information that you need for coding your own website.
